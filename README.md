# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm TÃ¼rkay

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Kocaeli University. My primary focus is on embedded systems, particularly real-time and low-level software development. I'm also part of the Vehicle Control unit in the KOU Racing Formula Student team, where Iâ€™m responsible for writing and maintaining the VCU (Vehicle Control Unit) software for our electric race car.

Aside from embedded systems, I also work on Android app development and Unreal Engine 5 game development as side interests.

Iâ€™m a strong supporter of free and open-source software, and I develop all my personal projects on Arch Linux.

## ðŸ’¼ Studio Dunkey
### I do my projects under a corp. named Studio Dunkey:
I operate a creative and software-oriented collective called Studio Dunkey, which focuses on:

- Android App Development â†’ Creating and publishing mobile apps with a focus on usability, privacy, and zero telemetry.
- Game Development â†’ Building experimental and indie games using Unreal Engine 5.
- Graphic Design & Publishing â†’ Designing and distributing creative digital content, including UI/UX, branding, and visual assets.

While Studio Dunkey doesnâ€™t involve my embedded systems work, it reflects my interests in software development, design, and digital publishing.

ðŸŽ¸ Hobbies & Interests

Iâ€™ve been involved with music for over 7 years, mainly as an electric guitar player. I also have hands-on experience with tools like Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and AutoCAD, which Iâ€™ve used for various design, editing, and technical drawing projects. I enjoy combining creativity with engineering in both my technical and artistic work.
